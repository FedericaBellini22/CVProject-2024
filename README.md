Pedestrian Intent Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles using the PSI Dataset

This project proposes a deep learning-based approach for predicting pedestrian intent using the PSI dataset. By addressing the limitations of existing algorithms and datasets, I aim to contribute to the development of safer and more socially intelligent autonomous vehicles capable of interacting efficiently with pedestrians in complex urban environments.
